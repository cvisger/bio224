1. I am planning on starting a new career as a spammer. I need to get a
bunch of e-mail addresses, so I want a regular expression that I can use
to search text files and match an e-mail address. I want to focus on
.edu addresses. Write a regular expression that will match email
addresses that end in .edu.

 .*@.*\.edu$



2. OK, my spamming career didn't pan out and now I am the new Vice
President of Pricing at Gizmos-R-Us. Everyone knows that prices that end
in 99¢ trick people into thinking the item it cheaper than it really is,
so my first task is to change the price of every item Gizmos-R-Us sells
to end in 99¢--so the $10.00 item will be $10.99, the $3.50 item $3.99
and the $2,300.00 item $2,300.99. Here's part of the catalog, write the
find and replace regular expressions to make the change. Be careful not
to mess up the product descriptions.

Socks: $2.34 
Door stops: $4.56 
Thermometers (0.00 to 100.00 degrees): $5.00 
Data loggers: $1,250.00 
$5 bills from 1856: $5.50

(.*\$.+)\.\d+
\1.99

3. Paste some text into a text document. Write regular expressions that
will match:

All words with double letters (ll, ee, oo, etc).  

(\w+?(\w)\1\w*)\s

 Words with at exactly 3 e’s (sequence) 
\w*e{3}\w*

 A line of text that does not have an "e" in it. 
^[^e]*$

4. What you think will match will not always be what matches.  In some
regular expressions you have to watch out for greedyness.  In the line
below, find an expression that matches just the tags (the angle brackets
and what is inside them), but not the word greedy:

      This is a <EM>greedy</EM> test.

[</]?\w+[>]





5. The first attached file, GNV.1943to2012.daily.txt, has the daily
temperature readings from the Gainesville Airport from 1943 to 2012. The
format of this file is explained in the second file,
GNV.weather.details.txt. Use these file for the following exercises.

GNV.weather.details.txtPreview the documentView in a new window



There is way too much data in these files! I just want to know the high,
low and mean temperature for each day. Using regular expressions in a
text editor, make a new file that has the following format:

YearMoDa \t High \t Low \t Mean



Paste the search string here:

\S*\s+\S*\s+(\S*)\s+(\S*)\s+\S*\s+\S*\s+\S*\s+\S*\s+\S*\s+\S*\s+\S*\s+(\S*)\s+(\S*).*\r

Paste the replace string here:

\1\t\3\t\4\t\2\r
